# Gnome-Chompski-Tracking-Database-System
A man-made invasive species called Gnome Chompskis have become an epidemic on Earth. Swarms of these pests have been wiping out towns and villages around the world. Some Gnome Chompskis have also been reported to have special mutations, such as using teeth as projectiles. The GenCorp CEO has divided up the swarms among each of GenCorpâ€™s members to better manage all the swarms. 

The purpose of this project is to create a method of tracking individual Gnome Chompski Swarms as well as the physical characteristics of each Gnome Chompski in their respective swarm. This is a rapidly changing situation, so a database is essential to ensure that each employee can remain up to date on the information for each Gnome Chompski in the world at all times.
